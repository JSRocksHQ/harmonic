I'm not pretty sure where he gave this talk, but i'm looking forward to watch the recording.
The slides content are great and explains a lot of things about ES6, and about the JavaScript itself.

A little descriptions about his talk (by him):
"We've entered the Ambient Computing Era and JavaScript is its dominant programing language, But a new computing era needs a new and better JavaScript. It's called ECMAScript 6 and it's about to become the new JavaScript standard. Why do we need it? Why did it take so long? What's in it? When can you use it? Answers will be given."

As soon as this talk recording is available, we'll post it here.
By now, follows the slides.
