Introduction:  

"ES6 modules are set to become the future replacement for the AMD and CommonJS module formats. They are defined by the current ES6 Specification and will be implemented in JavaScript engines in the future in both the browser and the server.  This article covers a variety of practical workflows for implementing ES6 modules. These approaches are very new, and there will still be edge cases, but these principles provide a path forward towards ES6 for use in both new and existing projects today".
